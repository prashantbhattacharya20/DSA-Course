Assignment:-
1. - Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
Pseudocode - Start
             initialize year
             input year
             if(year % 400 == 0) :
                print ("Given Year is a Leap Year")
             else if (year % 100 == 0) :
                print ("Given Year is not a Leap Year")
             else if (year % 4 == 0) :
                print ("Given Year is a leap year")
             else :
                print ("Given Year is not a leap year")
             exit

2. - Take two numbers and print the sum of the both.
Pseudocode - Start
             initialize a, b, sum
             print ("Enter two numbers for addition")
             input a, b
             set sum = 0
             sum = a + b
             print ("The sum of two numbers is - ")
             output sum
             exit

3. - Take a number as an input and print the multiplication table for it.
Pseudocode - Start
             initialize num, c, sum
             print ("Enter the number for which you want to print the multiplication table of: ")
             input num
             set c = 1
             set sum = 0
             while c <= 10
                sum = num * c
                println (num  + "x" + c + "=" + sum)
                exit
              c += 1
             end while
             exit

4. - Take 2 numbers and inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
Pseudocode - Start
             initialize n1, n2, lcm, hcf
             print ("Enter two numbers to find out their LCM and HCF")
             input n1,n2
             lcm = 0, hcf = 0
             lcm = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2
             while (true):
                if (lcm % n1 == 0 && lcm % n2 == 0) then
                   print ("The LCM of " + n1 + "and " + n2 + " is " + lcm)
               break while
             for(i = 0; i <= n1 && i <= n2; i+=1)
                if(i % n1 == 0 && i % n2 == 0)
                   hcf = i
                   exit if
                print ("The HCF of " + n1 + "and " + n2 + " is " + hcf)
               exit for
             exit

5. - Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.
Pseudocode - Start
             initialize num, c, sum, m
             print("Start entering numbers")
             set sum=0
             set c=0
             while 1:
                 num = int(input())
                 c = c + 1
                 sum = sum + num
                 print("Press x when you are done inputting the numbers")
                 m = input()
                 if m == 'x' :
                     break
             print("Sum : ",sum)
             exit
